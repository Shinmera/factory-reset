&# Level File Specification
This is a specification for a level data package. A level is a ZIP file with a set file structure. You can find an example at the end of the document.

## ZIP Contents
The only requirement about the zip file is that it must contain a `level.json` file at its root with the data structure conforming to the specification in the following section.

## Data File Format
This is a specification for the level data file format. The specification declares the structure in abstract terms of types, including structure types, and is thus not dependent on any particular interchange format. However, for the purposes of this game the format should be assumed to be **JSON**, encoded in **UTF-8** when serialised to binary.

### Specification Syntax
We employ a special syntax to denote the format.

:: BNF
Specification  ::= TypeDefinition*
TypeDefinition ::= name ':' Type '\n'
Type           ::= Structure | Array | Union | name | baseType
Structure      ::= '{' Entry (',' Entry)* '}'
Array          ::= '[' Type (' ' integer)? ']'
Union          ::= Type '|' Type
Entry          ::=  name ':' Type
baseType       --- One of the basic types noted in the following section
name           --- A name for an entry or type, alphanumerics only
integer        --- An integer larger than zero
::

White space may be used in between tokens as desired.

### Base Types
The specification assumes the following types to be present:

- //String// A sequence of arbitrary characters.
- //Integer// A numerical integer.
- //Float// A decimal number of limited precision.
- //Boolean// Either ``true`` or ``false``.
- //Null// An empty value.

### Data Validity
In order for the data to be valid, it must abide the following rules:

- The data must fit the ``Level`` type.
- Data specified to be a structure must contain all the defined fields and no more.
- Each field's value must be of the associated type.
- Data specified to be an array must only contain entries of the associated type.
- If the array type contains an integer, data specified to be of that array type must contain exactly as many entries.
- If the type is a union, the value must be of one of the two types of the union.

An implementation must signal an error if the data to be processed is not valid.

### Level Data Structure
We will now describe the level file format using the established conventions.

::
Level: {
  name: String,
  description: String,
  preview: Null | Path,
  next: Null | String
  startChase: Boolean,
  startChunk: Integer,
  storyItems: [ [ String ] ],
  chunks: [ Chunk ]
}

Chunk: {
  name: String,
  position: Vector,
  outside: Boolean,
  tileset: String,
  background: Null | String,
  storyItems: [ [ String ] ],
  layers: [ Path ]
}

Path: String
Vector: [ Float 2 ]
::

## Example ZIP
The following are the file records for an example level ZIP:

::
level.json
preview.png
chunks/first-0.png
chunks/first-1.png
chunks/first-2.png
chunks/first-3.png
::

And the following would be the JSON encoded contents of the ``level.json`` file:

:: JSON
{
  "name": "Example",
  "description": "An example level for the specification.",
  "preview": "preview.png",
  "next": "other-example",
  "startChase": false,
  "startChunk": 0,
  "storyItems": [[".. Wrong number."]],
  "chunks": [
    {
      "name": "first",
      "position": [0, 0],
      "outside": false,
      "layers": [
        "chunks/first-0.png",
        "chunks/first-1.png",
        "chunks/first-2.png",
        "chunks/first-3.png"
      ],
      "tileset": "sampleset",
      "background": null,
      "storyItems": [["Hello there, welcome to the game!"]]
    }
  ]
}
